_version_major = 2
u"""
The major version number.
Is only incremented when deep changes (that usually lead to a change of how the whole software is used) are made to the program.
Such changes include various feature additions / deletions / modifications, source code reorganisation and so on.
On a more NLP side, such changes could also include a change in corpora used in learning (if going from proprietary to free for example).
If this number is incremented, _version_minor and _version_patch are to be reseted to 0.
"""

_version_minor = 4
u"""
The minor version number.
Is only incremented when medium changes are made to the program.
Such changes include feature addition / deletion, creation of a new language entry for manual.
If this number is incremented, _version_patch is to be reseted to 0.
"""

_version_patch = 0
u"""
The patch version number.
Is only incremented when shallow changes are made to the program.
Such changes include bug correction, typo correction and any modification to existing manual(s) are made.
On a more NLP side, such changes would also include model changes.
