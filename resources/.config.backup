#  with at least one blank character seperating them or a new_line
#
# List of the different variables :
#  IN_FILE : the file to read.
#  OUT_DIRECTORY : the directory where every file will be created.
#  SEGMENTATION : {YES, Y, NO, N, TRUE, FALSE} whether or not the file needs to be segmented.
#  LEFFF_FILE : the file containing the Lefff dictionary. Do not mention if you do not want to use it, or leave an empty line.

#  CLEAN : {YES, Y, NO, N, TRUE, FALSE}, intermidiate files will be deleted after treatment.
#  HAS_TAGGING : {YES, Y, NO, N, TRUE, FALSE}, whether or not a set of tags is present and will thus be read from the input file.
